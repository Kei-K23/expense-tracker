# Expense Tracker App

Awesome and minimalistic expense tracker app that builds with Expo React Native.

⚠️ This is still in development ⚠️

## Check list

- [ ] Test authentication flow (why and what cause missing accountId).
- [ ] Test initial budget creation (why and what cause missing user id).
- [ ] Make sure all child elements are working properly in SkeletonContent component

## TODO FOR TOMORROW

- Create category or budgetCategory to alert the limited budget like (shopping or food) when exceed the amount then created notification and show alert to the user that they are exceeding their defined amount

## TODO

- [ ] Need to make strong relationship between user accounts, budgets and transactions
- [ ] Implement error handling more gracefully
