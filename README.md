# Expense Tracker App

Awesome and minimalistic expense tracker app that builds with Expo React Native.

⚠️ This is still in development ⚠️

## Check list

- [ ] Test authentication flow (why and what cause missing accountId).
- [ ] Test initial budget creation (why and what cause missing user id).
- [ ] Make sure all child elements are working properly in SkeletonContent component

## TODO

- [ ] Need to make strong relationship between user accounts, budgets and transactions
- [ ] Implement error handling more gracefully
